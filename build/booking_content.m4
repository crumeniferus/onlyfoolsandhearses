	<p>Bookings can be made in person by <a href="tel:m4_sinclude(`contact_tel_booking.txt')">calling m4_sinclude(`contact_name_booking.txt') direct on m4_sinclude(`contact_tel_booking.txt').</a>
	<p>Please refer to the calendar below to check when the horse-drawn hearse and Reliant Robin are available.</p>
	<p>Bookings are provisional until confirmed with a deposit. The deposit must be available as cleared funds no later than 2 days after the booking is made. Until that time, the booking remains provisional. Provisional bookings will be cancelled if the deposit is not received within the period stated. While we are waiting for a provisional booking to be confirmed, the calendar will show "busy" and we will keep that time for you unless the booking is cancelled.</p>
